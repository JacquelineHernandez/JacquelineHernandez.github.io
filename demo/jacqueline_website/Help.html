<h3>How can we speak up</h3>
<p>What you can do to speak up is talk to friends, family, workers in your job about what is going on. Vote in every way you can and turn up at the voting booth, and make the right choice to combat climate change â€“ national elections are the obvious one, but council elections, mayoral elections, or even electing the chair of your chess club could have a significant impact on the environment. When people don't know to read artcles that are in english they wont know what is happening.Their should be articles that have many different languages so they can unnderstand.People may not know what climate change is but they know it is a imapct and we could tell them how they can be prepare to adpat to the impact.</p>
